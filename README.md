> A beautiful and intuitive web app to use youtube as a music player 

![screenshot of main ui](https://i.redd.it/z2nrymdg2g511.png)

#### Context:
Many of us use Youtube to listen to music. But Youtube wasn't designed with music in mind. So, I created 'Rey' with simple and intuitive UI which takes youtube as data source! It is only for desktop now ( webapp and standalone app ).


**Details:**

Built with React ( But planning to switch to Preact )

Used react-easy-state instead of redux/mobx. It is way simpler.

Standalone app is nothing but an electron wrapper with https://desktop.appmaker.xyz/.

Used react-native-web to write the UI instead of html tags.

I wrote a detailed post on why I created rey here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/8sxjxo/rey_reimagined_youtube_music_player_for_desktop_i/
